Push your interfaces further and make websites more engaging by integrating animations throughout the site. In this course, learn how to leverage CSS to incorporate interactive animations that enhance features and layouts. Examine principles and best practices that should guide your use of animation. Find out how to use transitions, keyframe animations, and transforms to give users a better overall experience. Discover the importance of fine-tuning the duration, speed, and choreography of dynamic elements. See how to make buttons, menus, and cards more fun and inviting. Consider theories, practical uses, and more as you explore the use of movement in UI.

## Instructions
This repository has branches for each of the videos in the course. You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage, or you can add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to access.

## Branches
The branches are structured to correspond to the videos in the course. The naming convention is `CHAPTER#_MOVIE#`. As an example, the branch named `02_03` corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter. 
Some branches will have a beginning and an end state. These are marked with the letters `b` for "beginning" and `e` for "end". The `b` branch contains the code as it is at the beginning of the movie. The `e` branch contains the code as it is at the end of the movie. The `main` branch holds the final state of the code when in the course.
